# pcapdoctor plan

## Goal

`pcapdoctor capture.pcap` says what went wrong on the network in plain English, and names the frames to look at in Wireshark.

```
$ pcapdoctor examples/demo.pcap
examples/demo.pcap: 314 packets over 8.19 s, from 2025-10-09 08:53:20.000 UTC

✗ DNS   api.internal: name does not exist (NXDOMAIN, asked 3 times)             frames 41-42, 134
✗ TLS   pay.example.com:443: client rejected the handshake: unknown_ca (the certificate's issuer is not trusted)  frame 84
        → usually a private CA, or a TLS-inspecting proxy whose CA the client does not have
⚠ SLOW  api.example.com:443: network RTT 40.0 ms, server took 2.10 s to answer  frames 114-166
        → the server is slow, not the network
⚠ LOSS  10.0.0.5 → cdn.example.com:443: 7.4% of segments retransmitted (4 of 54), mostly by the server  frames 206-261
        → the capture saw the first copies, so packets were lost between the capture point and the client
✓ 11 other connections look healthy
```

That is real output, from [`examples/demo.pcap`](examples/demo.pcap): a generated capture of a laptop browsing for ten seconds (see `examples/gen_demo.py`).

Who it's for: support engineers handed a customer's capture, backend developers chasing "it's slow" or "it fails sometimes", and CI pipelines that should fail on network errors. None of them should need to know Wireshark.

## Principles

- **Answers, not packets.** Each finding is one sentence plus evidence: frame numbers and measurements anyone can check.
- **Never crash on bad input.** Captures are untrusted, often cut off, often snaplen-truncated. Decode what is there, say what isn't.
- **Offline first.** Reading files needs no libpcap/Npcap and no admin rights. Live capture is an optional extra.
- **Wireshark is the answer key.** Every detector is checked against tshark on real captures; where we differ on purpose, the docs say why.
- **One binary per OS**, no runtime dependencies.

## CLI

| Command | What it does | Milestone |
|---|---|---|
| `pcapdoctor dump FILE [-c N]` | one line per packet, like tcpdump | M1 |
| `pcapdoctor dump FILE -f FILTER` | same, filtered | M7 |
| `pcapdoctor stats FILE [-n N]` | protocol mix, busiest hosts, conversations | M2 |
| `pcapdoctor FILE [--format text\|json\|html] [-o PATH] [--all]` | diagnosis report (default command) | M6 |
| `pcapdoctor check FILE... [--fail-on FILTER]...` | CI mode: exit 1 when something matches | M7 |
| `pcapdoctor fields` | the fields filters can use | M7 |
| `pcapdoctor live [-i IFACE] [-d 30s] [-w out.pcapng]` | capture, then diagnose | M8 |
| `pcapdoctor interfaces` | what `live` can capture on | M8 |

Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 `check` found problems, 2 error.

## Architecture

```
capture/   pcap + pcapng readers and a pcapng writer (no libpcap) -> Frame { number, ts, link_type, data }
live/      libpcap or Npcap, loaded at run time                 -> Frame  (M8)
decode/    link -> IPv4/IPv6/ARP -> TCP/UDP/ICMP                -> Packet { layers, error }
flow/      bidirectional 5-tuple table, TCP state per flow      (M2)
analyze/   TCP health, DNS, TLS, HTTP detectors                  (M3-M5)
diagnose/  rules over the analysis                               -> Finding { severity, category, text, frames, measurements, filter }  (M6)
report/    text / JSON / HTML                                    (M6)
filter/    tokenizer -> parser -> AST -> evaluator               (M7)
```

Decoding borrows the frame bytes (zero-copy). When a layer is malformed, the layers before it are kept, like Wireshark's "[Malformed Packet]".

## Milestones

### M0 Scaffold — done 2026-10-13
Cargo project, CLI skeleton, CI (fmt, clippy, tests on Linux, Windows and macOS), this plan, README.

### M1 Read and decode — done 2026-10-13
- pcap (both byte orders, µs and ns timestamps) and pcapng (multiple sections and interfaces, `if_tsresol`, `if_tsoffset`, enhanced/simple/obsolete packet blocks) readers
- Cut-off files: keep every complete packet and warn, instead of failing
- Link layers: Ethernet with VLAN/QinQ, Linux cooked v1/v2 (`tcpdump -i any`), BSD/Windows loopback, raw IP
- IPv4 (options, fragments, zero length from TCP segmentation offload), IPv6 (extension headers, fragments), ARP, TCP (MSS, window scale, SACK, timestamps), UDP, ICMP, ICMPv6
- Lengths come from the IP headers, not the captured bytes, so Ethernet padding is never treated as data and snaplen captures still give real segment sizes
- `dump` command
- **Done when:** every layer has tests, the no-panic tests pass, and `dump` agrees with tshark on the sample captures.
- **Status:** tests include mutation tests (50k packets, 20k files). Against tshark 4.6.9 on 22 captures, every TCP/UDP frame matches: addresses, ports, flags, raw and relative seq/ack, window, length (2,217 frames).

### M2 Flows and stats — done 2026-10-13
- Flow table keyed by normalized 5-tuple; per-direction packets, bytes, first and last seen
- TCP connection state: SYN, SYN-ACK, established, FIN, RST
- Relative sequence numbers in `dump`
- `stats`: protocol distribution (packets and bytes), top talkers, conversation table, packets per second
- **Done when:** the conversation table matches `tshark -z conv,tcp`.
- **Status:** all 47 conversations in the same captures match tshark: stream number, endpoints, packets, bytes in each direction.

### M3 TCP health — done 2026-10-13
- RTT from the handshake, split into client side and server side
- Retransmissions (including spurious ones), out-of-order segments, duplicate ACKs, fast retransmits. Track the next expected sequence number per direction, with 32-bit wraparound.
- Zero window, window full
- RST classified: refused (answer to a SYN), aborted mid-stream, after FIN
- SYN never answered (connection timeout)
- **Done when:** counts match tshark's `tcp.analysis.*` on samples and on captures made with `tc netem` loss, apart from documented differences.
- **Status:** the rules follow Wireshark's `tcp_analyze_sequence_number`, in the same order. Every flag matches tshark on 2,161 TCP frames (198 flagged) across 21 captures, including `tests/fixtures/tcp-zoo.pcap`, a generated capture with one connection per case so all 14 kinds of flag are covered. Initial RTT matches tshark on all 19 connections that have one. A live capture of downloads with 2% loss from `tc netem` matches too (M8): 198 flags on 2,438 frames, among them 36 retransmissions and 122 duplicate ACKs. CI repeats that with 5% loss on every push.

### M4 DNS — done 2026-10-13
- Wire format: header, questions, answers (A, AAAA, CNAME, ...), name compression with loop protection; over UDP and TCP
- Match responses to queries (ID + flow). Report rcode failures (NXDOMAIN, SERVFAIL, REFUSED), queries with no response, slow responses, and ICMP port unreachable from the DNS server.
- IP → hostname map built from answers, so reports say `api.example.com` instead of `93.184.216.34`
- **Status:** checked against tshark on 170 DNS messages: ID, query or response, name, type, response code, answer count and response time all match, apart from two intended differences.
  - A query repeated more than 5 s later is still a retry of the same lookup. Wireshark starts a new transaction, but the client was waiting all along, so the response time counts from the first query. This is how a 5-second DNS stall shows up.
  - A response must come from the server the query went to. Wireshark matches on the ID alone.
  `tests/fixtures/dns-zoo.pcap` has one connection per case (error codes, no response, ICMP unreachable, retries, truncation then TCP, IPv6, malformed names), and tshark's view of it is committed.
  Not covered: multicast DNS and LLMNR (other ports), and encrypted DNS (DoH, DoT).

### M5 TLS and HTTP — done 2026-10-13
- TLS records and handshake: ClientHello SNI, ALPN, offered versions; ServerHello chosen version; alerts (handshake_failure, unknown_ca, certificate_expired, protocol_version, ...)
- TLS 1.2 certificates: subject, issuer, expiry (TLS 1.3 encrypts them)
- HTTP/1.x: request line, status code, per-request timing (reassemble the start of each request and response)
- **Network or server?** Server time ≈ time to first response byte − RTT
- **TLS status:**
  - TLS is recognized by content, so any port works and plain HTTP on 443 is not mistaken for it.
  - Covers hellos (including HelloRetryRequest and pre-standard TLS 1.3 drafts), certificate chains up to TLS 1.2 (own DER reader: names, issuer, validity), plaintext and encrypted alerts, and handshake completion.
  - Problems found: rejected handshakes with the alert's meaning; no ServerHello (reset, closed or no answer); expired, not-yet-valid, wrong-name and self-signed certificates; outdated versions; and a slow ServerHello net of the network round trip.
  - Checked against tshark on 1,138 TLS events across all test captures. `tests/fixtures/tls-zoo.pcap` has 15 cases with real certificates from a test CA, and tshark's view of it is committed.
  - Differences, all expected:
    - tshark decrypts captures that embed their keys; we don't.
    - An SSLv2-format ClientHello isn't supported.
    - In TLS 1.3 a 19-byte encrypted record before the client's Finished is read as an alert. That's a heuristic; tshark can't tell without keys.
  - Not covered yet: client certificates (mutual TLS), QUIC.
- **HTTP status:**
  - HTTP/1.x is recognized by content on any port.
  - All the body rules are followed: length, chunked, until close, HEAD/1xx/204/304, pipelining, `100 Continue`, upgrades and CONNECT tunnels.
  - Each response is matched to its request, with its time to first byte and server time. Server time is the time to first byte minus the capture-to-server round trip.
  - TCP reassembly now holds segments that arrive ahead of a gap until it fills. That gives the same result as Wireshark with out-of-order reassembly on.
  - Checked against tshark on `tests/fixtures/http-zoo.pcap`: every request and response matches on method, URI, host, status, and which request a response answers.
- **Encrypted traffic:**
  - Each TCP connection gets a "wait": from the client's last data to the start of the server's largest burst in reply. It needs no decryption.
  - The largest burst skips the small things a server may send first (TLS 1.3 session tickets, HTTP/2 settings) or last (a close alert on an idle connection).
  - On a real HTTPS capture that tshark can decrypt with its embedded keys, the largest wait came out at 158.6 ms. tshark's per-request times are 156–164 ms.
  - Not covered: per-request timing inside HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, which need decryption.

### M6 Diagnosis and report — done 2026-10-14
- Finding: severity (error, warning, info), category, one sentence, evidence frames, measurements
- Rules turn M3–M5 data into findings; everything else rolls up into a health summary
- Output: colored text (default), JSON (versioned schema), HTML (one self-contained file)
- `pcapdoctor FILE` becomes the default command
- **Done when:** the example at the top of this file is real output from a capture committed to the repo.
- **Status:**
  - The example at the top is the report for `examples/demo.pcap`, and a test keeps it that way. tshark agrees on everything it points at: the NXDOMAIN responses, the unknown_ca alert, the 40 ms round trip, and the four fast retransmissions.
  - Every finding carries a Wireshark display filter. Across all 49 test captures, each filter parses in tshark 4.6 and matches the frames its finding names.
  - Findings are grouped: one per name, server or client-and-server pair, not one per packet. Errors come first, then warnings and notes, each in capture order.
  - Rules and their thresholds:
    - DNS: error codes by name; servers that never answer or can't be reached; lookups slower than 500 ms or sent again.
    - TCP: refused and unanswered connection attempts by server, after 3 s. One client trying 10 or more ports on a server is reported as a likely port scan, not as failures.
    - TCP: connections reset by the server while open; a connect that needed a second SYN (500 ms beyond the round trip).
    - Loss: at least 3 retransmissions and 2% of segments between a client and server; an error from 10 retransmissions and 10%. It says who resent, and whether the capture saw the first copies, which places the loss before or after the capture point.
    - Slow servers: HTTP responses whose server time is over 500 ms. For connections it can't read into (mostly encrypted ones), a wait over 1 s beyond the network's part. Interactive ports (SSH, telnet, RDP, VNC) are skipped. A round trip of 250 ms or more gets a note.
    - TLS: the problems from M5, with a certificate problem the client rejected written as cause and effect.
    - HTTP: 5xx as errors, 4xx as warnings, and requests with no response, with what happened to the connection.
    - Receivers out of buffer (zero window). A sender filling the window 5 or more times gets a note.
    - The capture itself: cut-off files, packets cut short by a snaplen, packets that couldn't be decoded, packets the capture missed, and connections captured in one direction only.
  - Heuristics that keep noise down:
    - A failed lookup of a name with a search domain added (`api.example.com.corp.local` next to `api.example.com`) is the resolver at work, and isn't reported.
    - A missing reverse name is a note; a missing service record (`_ldap._tcp...`) is a warning.
    - A client resetting connections is a note, since applications often close that way.
    - A reset already explained by a TLS or HTTP failure isn't reported again.
    - On connections captured in one direction only, missing answers aren't reported: they may have been sent.

### M7 Filter language and CI mode — done 2026-10-14
- Wireshark-style syntax: `tcp.port == 443 && !(ip.src == 10.0.0.0/8)`, `dns.flags.rcode != 0`, `tcp.flags.reset == 1`, `tls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains "api"`
- Tokenizer → recursive-descent parser → AST → evaluator; error messages point at the column
- `dump -f`, and `check --fail-on` for packets and findings (`finding.severity == error`)
- GitHub Action wrapper
- **Status:**
  - The syntax and rules are Wireshark 4.6's, each checked with tshark: a field on its own tests that it is there; `==` matches any copy of a field and `!=` needs every copy to differ; a missing field matches no comparison; `&&` binds tighter than `^^`, and `^^` tighter than `||`; `matches` ignores case; sets need commas; numbers can be hex or octal, and some take Wireshark's names (`dns.qry.type == AAAA`, `dns.flags.rcode == "No such name"`, from `tshark -G values`).
  - 150 packet fields with Wireshark's names and types, listed by `pcapdoctor fields`. An ICMP error carries the fields of the packet it quotes, as in Wireshark: an unreachable DNS query matches `udp.port == 53` and `dns.qry.name`.
  - Fields that point forward in the capture (`dns.response_in`, `http.response_in`, and `tcp.analysis.initial_rtt`, which Wireshark already shows on the SYN-ACK) make pcapdoctor read the capture twice. So do the other DNS transaction fields: they follow Wireshark's matching, where a query sent again after 5 seconds starts a new transaction. The report keeps its own lookups, which count from the first try.
  - Checked against tshark:
    - Every field on every packet of 48 captures (4,589 packets, 688,000 values): 368 values differ, all in the cases below.
    - Every filter the report prints, 71 across those captures: each picks the same packets in both tools.
    - 80 filters that use every operator and function, on all 48 captures: of 3,840 runs, 19 pick different packets, all in the cases below.
    - `tests/fixtures/filters.tshark.txt` holds tshark's answers for 431 filters on the captures in this repository, including the report's, so CI checks them without tshark. A test fails when a finding's filter is missing from it.
  - Differences from Wireshark:
    - HTTP fields are on the frame that ends the headers, as in Wireshark with "Reassemble HTTP bodies" off. In that mode Wireshark also marks body frames as "Continuation" and sometimes loses track of a response after a body; pcapdoctor does neither. With its default settings Wireshark shows HTTP on the frame that ends the body.
    - Wireshark links pipelined responses to their requests only when the requests came in separate segments; pcapdoctor always does.
    - Wireshark finds DNS on any UDP port no other protocol claims. pcapdoctor reads DNS on port 53, and mDNS and LLMNR on 5353 and 5355.
    - TLS is recognized from the ClientHello, so the records of a connection that started before the capture aren't TLS to pcapdoctor; Wireshark goes by port 443. SSLv2-format hellos aren't read (M5).
    - Wireshark still shows the type and address of a DNS record whose name is broken.
  - `check` exits with 1 when any `--fail-on` filter matches, 0 when none does, and 2 on errors. The default is `finding.severity == error`. `--format github` adds workflow annotations. `action.yml` builds pcapdoctor and runs `check`; CI runs it on the demo capture both ways.

### M8 Live capture — done 2026-10-14
- libpcap on Linux/macOS, Npcap on Windows
- `live -i IFACE -d 30s [-w out.pcapng]`, plus a command to list interfaces
- Docs: Windows can capture with the built-in `pktmon`, no install needed
- **Status:**
  - libpcap is loaded when `live` or `interfaces` runs, not linked at build time (the plan was the `pcap` crate behind a cargo feature). A binary linked to Npcap's `wpcap.dll` doesn't start on a machine without Npcap, so release binaries would have had to choose between live capture and reading files anywhere. Loading it at run time gives one binary that does both, and says how to get the library when it's missing. The C API used is small: about 20 functions, in `src/live/ffi.rs`.
  - Packets are analyzed as they arrive, so memory doesn't grow with the length of the capture; `-w` streams them to a pcapng file (our own writer, with nanosecond timestamps when the system gives them).
  - Reads don't block: on Linux, libpcap's TPACKET_V3 can wait forever for the first packet whatever the timeout, so a quiet interface would never stop at `-d`. With nothing to read, pcapdoctor sleeps 20 ms and asks again.
  - Ctrl-C (or SIGTERM) ends the capture and prints the report; a second Ctrl-C, half a second or more later, gives up. Packets the system dropped because they weren't read in time become a capture warning, since they look like loss.
  - Without `-i` it picks the interface the default route goes through: connecting a UDP socket picks a route without sending anything.
  - Tested on Linux (WSL 2, libpcap 1.10.4): loopback and Ethernet, BPF filters, `-c`, `-d`, Ctrl-C and SIGTERM, a missing interface, no root. On a lossy capture (netem, 2,438 frames) every field matches tshark except `http`, where Wireshark marks body frames as continuations (a difference listed in M7). CI captures on Linux and macOS loopback on every push, and on Linux compares the analysis flags of a lossy transfer with tshark. Windows is tested only without Npcap: its installer has no silent mode outside the paid edition, so CI can't install it.

### M9 Release — done 2026-10-14
- cargo-dist: binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS, `cargo install`, maybe Scoop and Homebrew
- README: before/after (Wireshark screenshot next to pcapdoctor output), sample captures, notes on where we differ from tshark
- Launch posts built around a real debugging story (r/networking, r/sysadmin, Show HN)
- **Status:**
  - Pushing a `v*` tag builds a release with cargo-dist 0.33 (`dist-workspace.toml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`): binaries for Linux (x86_64 and ARM64), macOS (Intel and Apple silicon) and Windows (x86_64), checksums, and install scripts for the shell and PowerShell. v0.1.0 is the first.
  - Linux binaries link glibc rather than being static musl builds, because a static binary can't load libpcap at run time.
  - The GitHub Action downloads the release's binary when pinned to a tag (`@v0.1.0`), after checking its checksum, and builds from source otherwise.
  - The crate is ready for crates.io (`cargo publish --dry-run` passes, CI files left out); publishing needs the owner's token, so `cargo install pcapdoctor` waits for that. `cargo install --git` works now.
  - The README's before/after uses Wireshark's Expert Information as text (`tshark -z expert`) rather than a screenshot: for the demo capture it has no errors or warnings, only notes and chats. The differences from tshark and the sample captures have their own sections.
  - Not done: Scoop and Homebrew need a bucket and a tap repository of their own; worth doing when someone asks. The launch posts are not posted yet; they should come from the author.

### Later, only if users ask
IP reassembly, QUIC (SNI from Initial packets), HTTP/2, port-scan and DNS-tunnel detection, process names for live capture, Windows interface names ("Wi-Fi") in `interfaces`, live capture through pktmon when Npcap is missing, `--explain` through an LLM.

## Testing

- **Built captures:** unit tests per layer, plus integration tests that build packets and capture files in code (`tests/common`), so each edge case is a few lines with no binary fixtures.
- **No-panic tests:** random and mutated input through the readers and decoders. Later: `cargo fuzz`.
- **Wireshark as the answer key:** `tests/fixtures/tcp-zoo.pcap` is generated by `gen_tcp_zoo.py`, and `tcp-zoo.tshark.txt` is tshark's output for it. The tests compare against that file, so CI checks Wireshark's answers without tshark installed.
- **Making captures:**
  - Wireshark's sample captures
  - `tcpdump -w`
  - Windows: `pktmon start --capture --comp nics --pkt-size 0`, then `pktmon stop` and `pktmon etl2pcap PktMon.etl --out capture.pcapng` (admin, nothing to install)
  - `pcapdoctor live -w capture.pcapng`
  - Packet loss on Linux/WSL: `tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem loss 5%`
  - NXDOMAIN: `nslookup does-not-exist.example`
  - RST: `curl http://localhost:1`

## Decisions

- License: MIT or Apache-2.0 (decided 2026-10-13).
- Name: `pcapdoctor` was free on crates.io on 2026-10-13.
- Live capture loads libpcap at run time instead of linking it (2026-10-14); see M8.
