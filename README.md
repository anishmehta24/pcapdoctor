# pcapdoctor

Reads a packet capture and tells you what went wrong on the network, in plain English: failed DNS lookups, refused or reset connections, packet loss, TLS handshake failures, and whether a slow request was the network's fault or the server's.

```
$ pcapdoctor examples/demo.pcap
examples/demo.pcap: 314 packets over 8.19 s, from 2025-10-09 08:53:20.000 UTC

✗ DNS   api.internal: name does not exist (NXDOMAIN, asked 3 times)             frames 41-42, 134
✗ TLS   pay.example.com:443: client rejected the handshake: unknown_ca (the certificate's issuer is not trusted)  frame 84
        → usually a private CA, or a TLS-inspecting proxy whose CA the client does not have
⚠ SLOW  api.example.com:443: network RTT 40.0 ms, server took 2.10 s to answer  frames 114-166
        → the server is slow, not the network
⚠ LOSS  10.0.0.5 → cdn.example.com:443: 7.4% of segments retransmitted (4 of 54), mostly by the server  frames 206-261
        → the capture saw the first copies, so packets were lost between the capture point and the client
✓ 11 other connections look healthy
```

**Status: early.** The diagnosis report, filters, the CI check and live capture work, along with packet listing (`dump`) and capture summaries (`stats`). Release binaries are next; see [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

## Usage

`pcapdoctor FILE` prints the report above. Each finding is one sentence and the frames to look at in Wireshark. When the numbers point one way, a second line says what it most likely means. ✗ marks something that failed, ⚠ something degraded (slow, lossy, or failing some of the time), and • a note. [`examples/demo.pcap`](examples/demo.pcap) is a generated capture of a laptop browsing for ten seconds, to try it on.

It looks for:
- DNS: names that don't exist, server failures and refusals, servers that don't answer or can't be reached, slow and retried lookups
- TCP: refused and unanswered connections, connections the server reset, connects that needed a second SYN, receivers that ran out of buffer
- loss: how much was retransmitted, by whom, and whether it was lost before or after the capture point
- slow servers: the network's round trip against the server's own time, for HTTP and for encrypted connections alike
- TLS: rejected handshakes and why, certificate problems (expired, wrong name, self-signed), outdated versions, slow servers
- HTTP: error responses, and requests that never got one
- the capture itself: cut-off files, packets cut short, one-sided captures, and packets the capture missed

Options:
- `--format json`: for scripts. Each finding has its severity, frames, measurements, and a Wireshark filter that shows it. `schema` goes up when a field changes.
- `--format html -o report.html`: one self-contained page to attach to a ticket.
- `--all`: show every finding; text output stops after 30.
- `--color auto|always|never`: `NO_COLOR` is respected.

`dump` prints one line per packet:

```
$ pcapdoctor dump capture.pcap
     1    0.000000  172.16.5.1:49178 → 172.16.5.10:8443 TCP [SYN] seq=0 win=29200 len=0 mss=1460 wscale=7 sack_perm

```

- TCP sequence numbers count from the start of each connection, as in Wireshark; `-S` shows the raw values.
- TCP problems get Wireshark's labels, e.g. `[TCP Retransmission]` or `[TCP Dup ACK 9#2]`, decided by the same rules.
- DNS responses show their response time, and ICMP errors point back to the query that caused them.
- TLS handshakes show the server name, versions and ALPN, the certificate (before TLS 1.3, which encrypts it) and alerts.
- HTTP requests and responses show which request each response answers and the time to its first byte.

`stats` summarizes the whole capture:

```
$ pcapdoctor stats capture.pcap
...
Problem lookups: 8
Name             Type  Server          Result                        Time  Sent  Frame
broken.example   A     192.168.1.1:53  server failure             20.0 ms     1     10
nope.example     A     192.168.1.1:53  no such name               20.0 ms     1      8
blocked.example  A     192.168.1.1:53  refused                    20.0 ms     1     12
loop.example     A     192.168.1.1:53  malformed response          9.0 ms     1     34
down.example     A     192.168.1.2:53  server unreachable (ICMP)        -     1     20
```

It shows:
- the protocol mix
- the busiest hosts, with the names they were looked up by in DNS
- each TCP and UDP conversation, with round-trip time, retransmissions and state
- a summary of TCP problems
- DNS results
- HTTP results: status codes, server times, and the requests that failed or were slow
- for every TCP connection, its "wait": how long the client waited for the server's answer. This works for HTTPS too, without decrypting.
- TLS results, with problem handshakes explained, e.g. `client rejected the handshake: unknown_ca (the certificate's issuer is not trusted)` or `certificate is for other.example, not wrong.example`

Stream numbers match Wireshark's `tcp.stream` and `udp.stream`, so `tcp.stream == 1` in Wireshark shows the same connection.

Every field, flag and timing above is checked against tshark on real and generated captures. The few places where pcapdoctor differs on purpose are noted in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

Reads pcap and pcapng files directly, with no libpcap or Npcap needed. Supported link layers: Ethernet (with VLAN tags), Linux cooked (`tcpdump -i any`), loopback, and raw IP. Cut-off captures are read up to the last complete packet.

## Filters

`dump -f` takes a display filter in Wireshark's syntax, and a filter means the same in both tools:

```
$ pcapdoctor dump examples/demo.pcap -f 'tcp.analysis.retransmission'
   206    5.262300  203.0.113.30:443 → 10.0.0.5:50120 TCP [PSH, ACK] seq=8094 ack=589 win=64240 len=1400 [TCP Fast Retransmission]
   224    5.353800  203.0.113.30:443 → 10.0.0.5:50120 TCP [PSH, ACK] seq=20694 ack=589 win=64240 len=1400 [TCP Fast Retransmission]
   ...
```

- Fields have Wireshark's names and types: `ip.addr`, `tcp.port`, `tcp.flags.reset`, `dns.qry.name`, `tls.handshake.extensions_server_name`, `http.response.code`, the `tcp.analysis.*` flags and so on. `pcapdoctor fields` lists all 150.
- Operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `contains`, `matches` (a regular expression, ignoring case), `in {80, 443, 8000..8080}`, `&` for bits, and `&&`, `||`, `^^`, `!` (or `and`, `or`, `xor`, `not`). Addresses take networks, as in `ip.addr == 10.0.0.0/8`, and some numbers take names, as in `dns.qry.type == AAAA`. Functions: `lower()`, `upper()`, `len()`, `count()`.
- The rules are Wireshark's. A field on its own means it is there, so `tcp.flags.syn` matches every TCP packet and `tcp.flags.syn == 1` only SYNs. `!=` matches when no copy of the field is equal: `ip.addr != 10.0.0.1` leaves out packets to and from it.
- The filters in the report's JSON and HTML are filters like these, so `dump -f` shows the packets behind a finding.
- Mistakes are caught before the capture is read:
  ```
  $ pcapdoctor dump capture.pcap -f 'tcp.flags.rst'
  error: unknown field "tcp.flags.rst"; did you mean "tcp.flags.reset"?
    tcp.flags.rst
    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
  ```

Every field is compared with tshark on every packet of 48 captures, and so are the packets that filters pick. The differences are listed in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

## In CI

`pcapdoctor check` exits with 1 when a capture has problems, 0 when it hasn't, and 2 when it can't read the capture or the filter:

```
$ pcapdoctor check examples/demo.pcap
examples/demo.pcap: 2 findings match finding.severity == error
✗ DNS   api.internal: name does not exist (NXDOMAIN, asked 3 times)  frames 41-42, 134
✗ TLS   pay.example.com:443: client rejected the handshake: unknown_ca (the certificate's issuer is not trusted)  frame 84
        → usually a private CA, or a TLS-inspecting proxy whose CA the client does not have
```

`--fail-on` says what fails, and can be given more than once. It takes a packet filter, or a filter on the report's findings: `finding.severity`, `finding.category`, `finding.text`, and the numbers behind each finding, such as `finding.server_secs` or `finding.retransmission_rate`.

```
pcapdoctor check capture.pcap \
  --fail-on 'finding.severity >= warning && finding.category != slow' \
  --fail-on 'finding.server_secs > 1' \
  --fail-on 'tcp.analysis.zero_window'
```

In GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- uses: anishmehta24/pcapdoctor@main
  with:
    captures: captures/*.pcapng
    fail-on: finding.severity == error
```

Each finding becomes an annotation on the run, and the report goes to the job summary. Until there are release binaries, the action builds pcapdoctor from source, which takes about a minute.

## Live capture

`pcapdoctor live` captures from a network interface, then prints the same report. Here three downloads ran over a loopback link that Linux's `tc netem` made drop 2% of packets:

```
$ sudo pcapdoctor live -i lo -w loss.pcapng --capture-filter 'tcp port 8001'
Capturing on lo; Ctrl-C stops it
^C
loss.pcapng: 2,438 packets over 5.67 s, from 2026-10-14 13:36:35.733 UTC

⚠ LOSS  127.0.0.1 → 127.0.0.1:8001: 2.1% of segments retransmitted (36 of 1,738), mostly by the server, in 2 of 3 connections  frames 189-201, 272-2190
        → the first copies never reached the capture point, so packets were lost between the server and the capture point
✓ 1 other connection looks healthy
```

netem drops packets before the capture sees them, and the report places the loss there.

- `-i` takes the interface's name, its number in `pcapdoctor interfaces`, one of its addresses, or its description. Without `-i`, it captures on the interface with the route to the internet.
- `-d 30s` stops after a while and `-c 1000` after so many packets; Ctrl-C stops it any time. The report comes after.
- `-w capture.pcapng` keeps the packets, so the frames in the report can be opened in Wireshark.
- `--capture-filter 'port 443'` captures only what matches, in tcpdump's syntax. On a busy link that keeps the capture up to speed. If the system still drops packets, the report says how many, since a dropped packet looks like a lost one.
- It needs libpcap, which macOS has and Linux distributions package (`libpcap0.8` on Debian and Ubuntu), or [Npcap](https://npcap.com) on Windows. pcapdoctor loads it only for `live` and `interfaces`, so reading files never needs it.
- Capturing needs root (`sudo`) or administrator rights. On Linux, `sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip $(which pcapdoctor)` lets it capture without root.

## Getting a capture

- `pcapdoctor live -w capture.pcapng`, above
- Linux/macOS: `sudo tcpdump -i any -w capture.pcap`
- Windows, with nothing to install (as administrator):
  ```
  pktmon start --capture --comp nics --pkt-size 0 --file-name capture.etl
  pktmon stop
  pktmon etl2pcap capture.etl --out capture.pcapng
  ```
  `--comp nics` records each packet once, at the network card, instead of at every layer it passes.
- Wireshark: File → Save As → pcapng
